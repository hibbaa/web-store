		<h1>Ladder</h1>
		<p>
		A ladder is a tool which is made for people to climb up or down. Ladders have two vertical supports that go along the whole length of the ladder. Between these supports are the horizontal rungs. The rung is what the climber can put his foot on. The climber can use his hands to hold on to the rungs above him, or to the supports at the side

		<h1>Step Ladders:</h1>
		<p>
		Step ladders are the most commonly used ladder in the industry. In contrast to extension ladders; step ladders are self-supportable meaning they do not need to be leaned against any type of support to be used. As this is the case, they may be used in the middle of the room, underneath a tree for trimming or a variety of other locations where support is not available for an extension ladder. There are two major varieties of step ladders; the first is a simple front step ladder. On the front step ladder you will find rungs on one side of the ladder and the other side is desinged only for support and is not to be climbed on. The more popular variety is the twin step ladder which provides rungs on either side of the ladder allowing you to climb up whichever side is more convienent and allows you and a friend to climb the ladder simultaneously

		<h1>Extension Ladders:</h1>
		<p>Extension or "straight" ladders are normally the first type that comes to mind when you think of a ladder. This type is used to reach high places and most be leaned against some type of support; such as a house, wall, or tree before it can be used. Most extension ladders consist of two parts; the main piece is called the "base" and should always being firmly placed on the ground. The second part is called the "fly" and it is a moveable piece that can extend above the bed to allow the extension ladder to reach higher. Usually this sliding is done by use of a rope or hooks. This means most extension ladders have the ability to reach higher than you may first think when you see it "out of the box".</p>
